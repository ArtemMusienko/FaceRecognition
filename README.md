[![ru](https://img.shields.io/badge/README_на_русском-2A2C39?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](README.ru.md)

*The main task* is to implement face recognition using the **OpenCV** library and take into account a number of points described below.
The following points were implemented:
1. Found a photo of a famous actor named Brad Pitt;
2. Found an image of sunglasses;
3. Recognized the face in the photo by enclosing it in an oval;
4. Enclosed the eyes in the image with circles;
5. Placed sunglasses instead of the circles;
6. All face except eyes must be *blurred;*
7. Output the result as **4** images describing the step-by-step implementation of all points.

> The use of graphics accelerators is optional.
